### 🧐 **Overview**
**BEJO App** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to handle contextual question-answering for enterprise documents. It bridges the gap between high-performance proprietary models and privacy-focused local deployment.

---

### 🛠️ **System Architecture**
- **Frontend:** Built with **Next.js**, **Shadcn/UI**, and **Firebase** for a modern, responsive user experience.
- **Backend:** A robust **FastAPI** service managing document ingestion and chat threads.
- **Agent Routing:** Integrated **LangGraph** to dynamically route queries based on context.
- **Vector Store:** **Qdrant** provides efficient semantic search capabilities.

---

### 🌐 **Hybrid Deployment**
During development, the system utilized **Gemini 2.0 Flash** and `text-embedding-004`. For production environments requiring local data handling, I implemented a switch to:
- **Embedding:** `nomic-embed-text`
- **LLM:** `Qwen` (via **Ollama**)

This ensures the system is flexible, scalable, and capable of running in various infrastructure setups.

### 🚀 **Key Features**
- **📂 Smart Embedding:** `/upload?embed=true` endpoint for automated file processing.
- **💬 Contextual Chat:** `/chat/{thread_id}` for persistent, document-aware conversations.
- **🔍 Precision Search:** Semantic retrieval that finds exactly what you need.
