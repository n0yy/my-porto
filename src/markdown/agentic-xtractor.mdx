### 🧐 **Overview**
In my role at **SimplifyAI Consulting Indonesia**, I developed **Agentic Xtractor**, an advanced AI pipeline designed to solve one of the most tedious engineering tasks: extracting structured data from complex PDFs like Asset Registers, BOMs, and P&IDs.

### 🧠 **The Agentic Architecture**
Instead of a simple linear script, I built this system using a **modular LangGraph-based architecture**. It uses custom agents that act like specialized workers:
- **🔍 Retrieval Agent:** Uses **Qdrant** for high-precision semantic search to find relevant document sections.
- **📄 Parsing Agent:** Analyzes complex tables and engineering diagrams.
- **✅ Verification Agent:** Cross-checks extracted data against source material to ensure accuracy.

---

### 📊 **Impact & Performance**
- 🎯 Achieved up to **90% extraction accuracy** across diverse document types.
- ⚡ Significantly reduced manual data entry time for engineering teams.
- 🏗️ Built to handle high-complexity documents that traditional OCR struggles with.

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph
- **Vector Store:** Qdrant
- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Run
- **Models:** Multimodal LLMs for image and text analysis.
