### 🧐 **Overview**
Maintenance costs can cripple industrial operations. My goal for this project was to design a system that predicts equipment failure before it happens, classifying conditions into **Normal**, **Warning**, and **Leak**.

### 📊 **The Machine Learning Approach**
Working with **multivariate time series data**, I benchmarked several models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM. 
- **🏆 Winner:** **LightGBM** was selected for its superior precision and recall, especially handling the **imbalanced nature** of failure data.
- **🔧 Optimization:** Applied extensive hyperparameter tuning to ensure maximum reliability in detection.

### 🖥️ **Real-time Monitoring**
I built a data dashboard using **Streamlit** that allows operators to:
- Monitor equipment health in real-time.
- Trigger model inference on new sensor data.
- Visualize historical trends and anomaly patterns.

This project demonstrates the power of ML-driven decision-making in high-stakes environments.
